Rene has been consulting, both in-house as externally, for almost 20 years. He is a former Microsoft Azure MVP who "eats, sleeps and breathes" intelligent automation and integration and has  worked across a multitude of industries including retail, transport, oil & gas , finance, education, healthcare and government.

Over the last few years Rene has naturally transitioned more into different leadership roles, from being a solution architect and principal consultant to his current role at [Servian[(https://www.servian.com)]] in Sydney, Australia as Managing consultant.

But no matter what Ren√© still has a sharp interest on all things integration, automation and low/no-code related, and as such loves to keep on learning new things by means of being hands-on whenever he can and sharing his knowledge with everyone who is interested.
