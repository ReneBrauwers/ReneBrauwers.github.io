Whenever you get into a position where you are blogging about a subject matter just because you have a blog; you actually know it is time to quit. Well exactly this happened with my previous blog, I simply did not have anything to add to the community as a result the blog posts where mediocre and of no real value (at least not to me).

But hey, you might think; why are you blogging now? Well simple I actually have something to share again, and what precisely you will discover over the next few weeks and months.

However rest assure; I'll only try to blog whenever I have something which in my opinion adds value as a result this could mean that there will be no updates or only links to fellow bloggers.

So let's get back to business...

Cheers
