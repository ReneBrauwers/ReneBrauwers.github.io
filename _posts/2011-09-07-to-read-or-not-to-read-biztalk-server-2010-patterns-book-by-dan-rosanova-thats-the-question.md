<blockquote>Disclaimer: Yes I am plugging a book ;-)</blockquote>
Almost every day new (technical) books are released and each and every day we as developers, administrators, architects, managers and/or mere mortals are burdened with the decision ‘to read or not to read’ a particular book.

&nbsp;

Well as of this October we as BizTalk-ers will be facing one of the toughest decisions ever since the release of BizTalk Server 2006 (I simply love exaggerating it a bit) as <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PACKT publishing</a> will be releasing <a href="http://www.novaenterprisesystems.com/Blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Rosanova’s</a> book <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/biztalk-server-2010-patterns/book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BizTalk Server 2010 Patterns</a>

&nbsp;

In order to help you all with deciding wither to (pre)order or not to (pre)order this book I’ve included the below mentioned ‘Decision Tree’

&nbsp;

<blockquote>You might be thinking: “Why is he shamelessly promoting a book?”</blockquote>
Well to answer the above question… I am promoting this book as <a href="http://soa-thoughts.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steef-Jan Wiggers</a> (BizTalk MVP) and <a href="http://biztalkmessages.vansplunteren.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Randal van Splunteren</a> (BizTalk MVP) and  I had the honor to be part of the Technical Review process of “<a href="http://www.novaenterprisesystems.com/Blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Rosanova’s</a> book <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/biztalk-server-2010-patterns/book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BizTalk Server 2010 Patterns</a>” and honestly this book is a must read even if you consider yourself (or are called by others) a BizTalk Guru/Expert as I am convinced that we all as BizTalk-ers can and will learn from it and after all that’s what we all do and what we all crave “Learning new stuff” and the best part of it: Not only you will benefit by learning new insights your current and future customers will benefit as well…

&nbsp;
<blockquote>So what can you expect in this book?</blockquote>
Well my former colleague <a href="http://soa-thoughts.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steef-Jan Wiggers</a> and BizTalk MVP sums it up pretty neatly in his latest <a href="http://soa-thoughts.blogspot.com/2011/09/biztalk-server-2010-patterns-by-dan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog-post</a> so I will not repeat it here.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Anyway you can (pre)order the book now! It is currently available for (pre)order at either <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/biztalk-server-2010-patterns/book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PACKT publishing</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BizTalk-Server-2010-Patterns-Rosanova/dp/product-description/184968460X/ref=dp_imagepop_readmore_b?ie=UTF8&amp;n=283155&amp;s=books" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>
